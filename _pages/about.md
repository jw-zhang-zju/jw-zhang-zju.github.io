I am currently a Research Fellow (a.k.a Assistant Research Professor) in [State Key Laboratory of Block Chain and Data Security, Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes software engineering, such as AI for SE, mining software repositories, etc. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Professor Shanping Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0087125), [Professor Xin Xia](https://xin-xia.github.io/),  [Associate Professor Lingfeng Bao](https://baolingfeng.github.io/), [Assistant Professor Zhongxin Liu](https://zhongxin-liu.github.io/), [Associate Professor Xing Hu](https://xing-hu.github.io/), Zhejiang University. I was advised by [Professor Min Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K8oe7sMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) from Chongqing University. You can find my CV here: [Junwei's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
